# Allows attributes to be declared as lazy, meaning that they won't be
# computed until they are asked for. Just mix this module in:
#
#   class Foo
#     include Lazy
#     ...
#   end
#
# To specify a lazy reader:
#
#   lazy_reader :att
#
# Then, define a method called __bake__ that computes all your lazy
# attributes:
#
#   def __bake__
#     @att = ...
#   end
#
# If you happen to have already done all the hard work, you can mark an instance
# as already baked by calling:
#
#   __baked__
#
# That's it! (Tom Preston-Werner: rubyisawesome.com)
